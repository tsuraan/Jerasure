# About #
This is the Jerasure project, by James S. Plank, Scott Simmerman, and
Catherine D. Schuman.  More details can be found at
[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/CS-08-627.html](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/CS-08-627.html)

See technical report CS-08-627 for a description of the code.  

There are two directories:

* The project home directory contains the jerasure code.
* The Examples directory contains the example programs.  

## Hints ##
It is assumed that GNU make is being used.
